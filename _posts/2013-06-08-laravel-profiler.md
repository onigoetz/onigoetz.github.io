<div>After a few years, I took the time to clean up the code of my Profiler and publish it on Github
<a href="https://github.com/onigoetz/profiler">https://github.com/onigoetz/profiler</a>

Also available on <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/onigoetz/profiler">packagist</a>

It's a simple profiler for Laravel4 able to provide you with precious informations about your code.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This version is still young, but should be quite stable.</div>
<div></div>
<div>7 panels are available for the moment :</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Time : gives only the full page execution time for the moment, the idea is to provide a full breakdown of the different parts of the execution, like in the symfony profiler</li>
	<li>Database : shows the queries and the bindings</li>
	<li>Routes : lists the routes and highlights the matched route</li>
	<li>Variables: dumps the GET/POST/FILES/COOKIES/Session/SERVER variables</li>
	<li>Log: dumps the logs directly from monolog</li>
	<li>Files: lists the loaded files</li>
	<li>Bookmarklets: a few useful bookmarklets</li>
</ul>
I hope this package can help you profile your application.

</div>
