Hi to everybody !

It's been a long time !

I just wanted to tell you all that I didn't forget that many of you are waiting for new updates on my plugin "PHPBB Single Sign On"

I'm not here to tell you that there won't be any new version !

But now, I'm on a very big project that will be released in beta version in august, and I'm the only developper on the project.

Just to give you an Idea of how big the project is, at the very beginning we started it with drupal. then we started to add all the plugins we needed : maps, geolocation, facebook connect ... and BAM ! the www folder weighted ... 100Mo !!!

for a web project, that is very big (on my advice)

But we took the decision to code it all by ourselves.

It's a lot of work. but it's a lot more optimized, and a great advantage is that I know EVERYTHING that is in my code !!!

Even if I like Wordpress, And I use Drupal at work, I still prefer "Home Dev".

So, I stop the parenthesis here.

That's just to tell you that I will still be supporting my plugin in the future, and I hope one day to have the version 1.0 out !

(If someone wants to work with me on the plugin, send me a message through the contact form with your email, I would be happy to have someone else with me on this :D)
