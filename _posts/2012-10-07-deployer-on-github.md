Hi !

It's been a really long time, (more than two years actually &gt;_&lt;)

I've been working very hard on my latest project : <a href="http://youmewine.ch">Youmewine</a> if you live in Switzerland and like wine, you might be interested in what we do :D

&nbsp;

So, back to my post.

Deployer is a tool that I made for youmewine, used to deploy my projects to my servers quickly and effortlessly

Its main objective is to have no software installed on the server. An SSH access is enough to make the script work!

You can check it out here : <a href="https://github.com/onigoetz/deployer">https://github.com/onigoetz/deployer</a>

For the moment the only source it can handle is a git repository, but I can add more if needed or you can make a Pull Request ;-)
