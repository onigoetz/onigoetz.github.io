Hi to all,

Five Months ago, I published the PHPBB Signle Sign On Plugin.

It's now time I use it on my own website.

As you may have noticed, I made a new design on the website for the occasion.

So now, Instead of sending me an email through the Contact form, or replying to a post.

You can directly post a new topic. isn't it amazing ?

The reason it took me so long to publish this forum is because I had a conflict with a plugin.

I had to replace it by another plugin to make it work.

But now it's waiting for your feedbacks ;-)
