You all saw it, the plugin acted buggy these days

First it didn't work at all.
And then it worked but showed a debug line at the top of the screen.

Now it's all fixed, so there is the version 0.6.2

With the fullsize in version 1.1.1 from the official website : <a href="http://www.addfullsize.com/">http://www.addfullsize.com/</a>

You can change all properties in the wordpress options.

Sorry for the inconvenience, and enjoy this great plugin !
