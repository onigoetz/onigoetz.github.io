There are already many was to make a lightbox.

But a newcomer gives an innovative solution.

With the idea that many sites already have a lightbox, why not make them a standard ?

Drew Wilson proposes to add the "Fullsize" attribute to the img tag.

After all, it's not a bad idea, because it could be used by a bunch of browsers, RSS Readers or other mobile phones.

The Developper invites people to sign the petition on his <a href="http://www.addfullsize.com/">own site</a>. And better, there is a jQuery plugin already available!

But because the "fullsize" attribute doesn't exist, it uses the "longdesc" attribute.
