I wrote a post about bad CSS support last month, presenting some workarounds for older browsers.

This time it's another way of doing it that I will present to you.

<a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/">Aaron Gustafson</a> Author in <a href="http://www.alistapart.com">A list Apart</a> and many other blogs and webzines.

Created a sort of "browser plugin". presented in the form of a Javascript script.

It will parse the CSS in your page. and apply the styles that are not supported by your browser.

Even better. you can create your own extension. This means you can create your CSS rules as you want.

No more problems with browsers, and we hope the community will quickly create some new extensions to CSS.

First, to support CSS3 and then to support some new ideas.

My Contribution will be a new Wordpress plugin. As you understood, I love Wordpress for it's plugin abilities. And I'll create many new plugins these next months.
