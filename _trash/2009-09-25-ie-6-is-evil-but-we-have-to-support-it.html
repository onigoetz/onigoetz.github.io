We (by we I mean all web developpers) all know that Internet explorer is a real nightmare for web design and developping.

Everytime that we make a nice effect or a nice design. It turns out that IE 6 doesn't support it.

For a little example, who tried to create a position:fixed element on a page. and gave up because he didn't want to put some javascript in his page?

Yeah I know, that's scary. By the way, put down your hand, you look idiot by raising your hand behind your computer.

But that's enough !!!

The guys from <a href="http://www.virtuosimedia.com">Virtuosi Media</a> made a Best Practices Guide for IE 6.

A guide that helps to avoid the most commons problems of this browser.

Here is the link to the Tutorial : <a href="http://www.virtuosimedia.com/tutorials/ultimate-ie6-cheatsheet-how-to-fix-25-internet-explorer-6-bugs">http://www.virtuosimedia.com/tutorials/ultimate-ie6-cheatsheet-how-to-fix-25-internet-explorer-6-bugs</a>
